# Regression-Models-Course-Project

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Executive Summary 
This report is done for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry.
This report aims to explore the relationship between a set of variables of different type of cars and the MPG value (Mile per gallon) as an outcome.
The report particularly interested in the following two questions: 
 * Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
 * Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
The report provides some exploratory data analysis 
suggest several linear regression models for predicting the outcome(MPG), compare them
and analyze the residual of the selected model.
